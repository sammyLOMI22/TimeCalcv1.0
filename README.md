# TimeCalcv1.0
### Description
Basic android app that calculates duration of hours and minutes between two times in a 24 hour period.
App icon and assets created by me in Affinity Designer. This is just one activity I plan on integrating into the final version of app. 


### Future Plans for Version 2.0
1.Use time picker class instead of EditText field.<br/>
2.Include more time calculation activities.<br/>
3.Improve User interface.<br/>
4.Get rid of hardcoded text.
